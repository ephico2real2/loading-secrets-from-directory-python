To adapt the script for handling multiple custom secrets such as `CUSTOM_SECRET_1`, `CUSTOM_SECRET_2` etc, and so on, you can modify the `DjangoSecretsWatchdog` class to load these additional secrets into Django's settings.


### Updated django_secrets_watchdog.py

```python
import os
import sys
import time
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
import logging

# Configure Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
import django
django.setup()

from django.conf import settings
from your_app.utils.secrets_loader import SecretsLoader

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class DjangoSecretsChangeHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def __init__(self, secrets_dirs, callback):
        self.secrets_dirs = secrets_dirs
        self.callback = callback

    def on_modified(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            logging.info(f"Detected modification in: {event.src_path}")
            self.callback()

    def on_deleted(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            logging.info(f"Detected deletion of: {event.src_path}")
            self.callback()

class DjangoSecretsWatchdog:
    def __init__(self, secrets_dirs):
        self.secrets_dirs = secrets_dirs
        self.secrets_loader = SecretsLoader(secrets_dirs=secrets_dirs)

    def load_secrets_to_settings(self):
        # Example: Load database secrets
        settings.DATABASES['default']['NAME'] = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_DB')
        settings.DATABASES['default']['USER'] = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_USERNAME')
        settings.DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD'] = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_PASSWORD')
        settings.DATABASES['default']['HOST'] = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_HOSTNAME')
        settings.DATABASES['default']['PORT'] = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_PORT')

        # Load additional secrets
        settings.CUSTOM_SECRET_1 = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('CUSTOM_SECRET_1')
        settings.CUSTOM_SECRET_2 = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('CUSTOM_SECRET_2')
        # Add more custom secrets as needed
        # settings.CUSTOM_SECRET_N = self.secrets_loader.get_credential('CUSTOM_SECRET_N')

        logging.info("Secrets successfully loaded into Django settings.")

    def run(self):
        self.load_secrets_to_settings()
        event_handler = DjangoSecretsChangeHandler(self.secrets_dirs, self.load_secrets_to_settings)
        observer = Observer()
        for directory in self.secrets_dirs:
            observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=False)
        observer.start()
        logging.info("Starting Django secrets watchdog...")
        try:
            while True:
                time.sleep(10)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            observer.stop()
            observer.join()
            if self.connection:
                self.connection.close()  # Ensure the database connection is closed gracefully

if __name__ == "__main__":
    secrets_dirs = ['./path/to/db_secrets', './path/to/additional_secrets']
    watchdog = DjangoSecretsWatchdog(secrets_dirs)
    watchdog.run()
```

### Notes

- **Handling Multiple Secrets**: This script dynamically loads multiple custom secrets into Django's settings. You can add as many custom secrets as required by replicating the pattern shown for `CUSTOM_SECRET_1` and `CUSTOM_SECRET_2`.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The script uses the `watchdog` library to monitor specified directories for changes to secrets files and reloads them into Django's settings dynamically. This ensures that your application can use the latest configurations without needing to restart.
- **Security and Best Practices**: Ensure the secure storage of your secrets files and control access to them. Consider using Django's secure handling mechanisms wherever possible and avoid logging sensitive information in production environments.


Integrating dynamic secrets management into Django's `settings.py` using a script like `django_secrets_watchdog.py` involves loading your secrets from files at startup and optionally setting up a mechanism to refresh these dynamically if they change. This process enhances security and flexibility, especially in environments where secrets might rotate or change frequently.

### Initial Setup in `settings.py`

In your Django project's `settings.py`, you typically define configurations such as database connections, secret keys, and other sensitive information. To integrate with `secrets_loader.py`, you'll initially load these configurations from your secrets files when Django starts. Here's how to adapt your `settings.py` for dynamic secrets loading:

```python

# settings.py
import os
from your_app.utils.secrets_loader import SecretsLoader

# Define the paths to your secrets directories
SECRETS_DIRS = ['./path/to/db_secrets', './path/to/additional_secrets']

# Initialize the SecretsLoader with your secrets directories
secrets_loader = SecretsLoader(SECRETS_DIRS)

# Load database configuration from secrets
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  # Or the appropriate backend
        'NAME': secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_DB'),
        'USER': secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_USERNAME'),
        'PASSWORD': secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_HOSTNAME'),
        'PORT': secrets_loader.get_credential('MYSQL_PORT'),
    }
}

# Load other secrets as needed
CUSTOM_SECRET_1 = secrets_loader.get_credential('CUSTOM_SECRET_1')
CUSTOM_SECRET_2 = secrets_loader.get_credential('CUSTOM_SECRET_2')
# Repeat for other secrets as needed
```

### Dynamic Secrets Reloading

The Django framework is designed with immutability of settings in mind for security and architectural reasons. This means that once Django starts, changing settings dynamically (such as updating `DATABASES` or other settings based on new secrets) is against the framework's design principles and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

However, for certain use cases (e.g., updating API keys or other non-Django-managed settings), you might still want to dynamically reload secrets:

1. **Custom Command**: Implement a Django custom management command that invokes `django_secrets_watchdog.py` to keep watching and reloading secrets as needed. This command could be run in parallel to your `runserver` or deployment command.

2. **Middleware or View Decorators**: For settings that can't be dynamically changed at the global level (like database configurations), consider using middleware or decorators to apply settings at the request level. This can be useful for API keys or other settings that influence application behavior but aren't tied to Django's initialization.

### Limitations and Considerations

- **Database Settings**: Dynamically changing database settings at runtime is not supported by Django ORM. If database credentials change, you typically need to restart your Django application for the changes to take effect.
- **Security Implications**: Ensure the security of the mechanism you use to reload settings, especially when deploying in production environments. Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages.
- **Performance**: Continuously monitoring and reloading settings can have performance implications. Ensure that this does not negatively impact your application's response times or resource usage.

### Conclusion

Integrating dynamic secrets management into Django's `settings.py` enhances flexibility and security, especially in cloud environments or scenarios requiring frequent updates to configurations. While Django's design limits the dynamism of certain settings like database configurations, other settings can still be dynamically managed with careful planning and implementation. Always test thoroughly in a staging environment before rolling out changes to production to ensure stability and security.


Incorporating the `on_secrets_changed` method into the Django integration context requires adjusting the approach slightly, given Django's architecture and how it manages settings. The direct dynamic updating of settings like `DATABASES` at runtime isn't straightforward due to Django's design, which freezes settings after startup for security and stability reasons. However, for other types of secrets that don't directly affect Django's core settings (like API keys, external service credentials, etc.), you can implement a mechanism to refresh these dynamically if they change.

To effectively use an `on_secrets_changed` callback within a Django application context, especially for secrets like `CUSTOM_SECRET_1`, `CUSTOM_SECRET_2`, etc., you could consider the following strategy:

### Strategy for `on_secrets_changed` in Django

1. **Custom Django Command**: This command keeps running in the background (similar to `runserver`) and listens for file system changes to reload secrets.

```python
# In your_app/management/commands/watch_secrets.py

from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.conf import settings
from your_app.utils.secrets_watchdog import DjangoSecretsWatchdog

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Watches secret files for changes and updates Django settings dynamically.'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # Assuming DjangoSecretsWatchdog is adapted to work with Django
        secrets_watchdog = DjangoSecretsWatchdog(
            secrets_dirs=settings.SECRETS_DIRS,
            on_secrets_changed=self.on_secrets_changed
        )
        secrets_watchdog.run()

    def on_secrets_changed(self):
        # Reload secrets and update settings
        # Note: Directly modifying Django settings at runtime is not recommended.
        # This should only update custom settings or trigger reloading where appropriate.
        print("Secrets changed. Implement custom logic to handle this event.")
```

2. **Implementing Dynamic Updates**: For settings that can be dynamically updated without causing issues (non-Django core settings), you can implement the update logic within `on_secrets_changed`. This could involve refreshing API client configurations, updating application-level caches, or other custom settings that aren't frozen by Django.

3. **Limitations**: Remember, you cannot dynamically change settings that affect Django's initialization (like database configurations) without restarting the application. For such changes, consider external triggers to restart your application safely.

### Running the Command

To run the custom command:

```bash
python manage.py watch_secrets
```

This command should be run in parallel to your Django application server (e.g., `runserver`, Gunicorn, or uWSGI process) in a development environment or as part of your deployment strategy in production.

### Conclusion

The `on_secrets_changed` method requires careful implementation in the Django context, primarily due to the framework's design around settings immutability. While direct integration for core settings like `DATABASES` isn't feasible without restarting the application, this approach allows for dynamic updates to custom application-level settings or secrets that can be modified at runtime. Always ensure that any dynamic settings management adheres to security best practices and thoroughly test your implementation to understand its implications fully.
